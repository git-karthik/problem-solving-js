### Longest Increasing Sequence

You are given an array of non-repeating integers as an argument. Return an array containing the longest increasing sequence of values found in the argument array.

The argument array will always have at least two values that will match this condition.

#### Requirements

Must return an array of integers
Must handle negative integers

#### Example #1

solve([10, 7, 5, 20, 21, 23, 9])

> [5, 20, 21, 23]

#### Example #2

solve([-10, -7, -5, -20, 21, 20, 9])

> [-10, -7, -5]
